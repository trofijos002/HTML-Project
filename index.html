  <h1>To be fair...</h1>
  <h3>You have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty.</h3>
    <p><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeGN_4gT5Tk">To be fair,</a> you <i>have</i> to have a very high <b>IQ</b> to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely <sup>subtle</sup>,<br> 
      and without a solid grasp of <i><b>theoretical</b></i> physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. <br>
      There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws<br>
      heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual<br>
      capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something<br>
      deep about <b>LIFE</b>. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate,<br>
      for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference<br>
      to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons<br>
      scratching their heads in confusion as <a href = "https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_596,c_limit,q_auto:best,f_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2017/09/i-1-dan-harmon-hs.jpg">Dan Harmon’s</a> genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools..<br>
      how I pity them. 😂<br><br>
      And yes, by the way, i DO have a <a href = "http://nextluxury.com/wp-content/uploads/leg-cool-rick-and-morty-tattoo-design-ideas-for-male.jpg">Rick & Morty tattoo</a>. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎</p>
