  <h3>You have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty.</h3>
  
  
    <p>To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle,<br> 
      and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. <br>
      There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws<br>
      heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual<br>
      capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something<br>
      deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate,<br>
      for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference<br>
      to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons<br>
      scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools..<br>
      how I pity them. 😂<br><br>
      And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎</p>
